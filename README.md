Welcome to the **House Rent Price Predictor** for metropolitan Indian cities!  
This project uses **machine learning** to estimate rental prices based on property details such as area, layout, city, and locality. A **Streamlit** app provides an intuitive user interface.



## Objective

Build and deploy a machine learning model that can:
- Predict house rental prices in major Indian cities
- Incorporate both numerical and categorical features
- Provide a simple web-based prediction tool using Streamlit

## Project Walkthrough 

**Data Loading**: 

Retrieved rental data from `Kaggle` containing listings across 8 Indian metropolitan cities.

**EDA & Cleaning**: 

Explored patterns, handled outliers, and addressed skewness using log transformation for `price` and `area`.

**Feature Engineering:**

Added `city_wise_gdp` to bring in economic context.

Introduced `avg_price_locality` for locality-based pricing.

**Preprocessing Pipelines:**

Custom transformers integrated with ColumnTransformer for numeric, categorical, and locality-specific features.

`Scaled` numerical features and `one-hot encoded` categoricals.

**Modeling:**

Trained using `RandomForestRegressor`, tuned with `RandomizedSearchCV`.

Achieved **~86%** accuracy on test data and **~96%** on train.

**Deployment:**

Built a clean **Streamlit app**. Allows user inputs and returns rent predictions in real time.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - House Rent Prices (India)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saisaathvik/house-rent-prices-of-metropolitan-cities-in-india)
- Target: `price` (monthly rent)

## Note

> This model is built for **educational purposes only**.  
It is not suitable for production use without further validation and improvements.
